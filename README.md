## Description of Physics System Implementation

### Core Physics Engine

Our basketball simulation implements a comprehensive physics system with realistic basketball mechanics:

**Gravity Simulation**:

- Constant downward acceleration (-9.81 \* 1.2 m/sÂ²)
- Realistic parabolic trajectory for basketball shots
- Time-based physics calculations for smooth 60fps performance

**Collision Detection System**:

- **Ground Collision**: Ball bounces with energy loss (decay factor: 0.7)
- **Rim Collision**: Sophisticated collision detection with minimal energy loss (0.05 decay)
- **Backboard Collision**: Realistic bounce mechanics with moderate energy loss (0.4 decay)
- **Boundary Collision**: Court edge detection with controlled bouncing

**Advanced Physics Features**:

- **Air Resistance**: Realistic drag simulation (0.99 resistance factor)
- **Trajectory-Based Scoring**: Ball must pass through rim from above with proper downward velocity
- **Anti-Cheat Protection**: Prevents scoring from touching net bottom or unrealistic angles
- **Stuck Ball Detection**: Time-based position sampling prevents infinite physics loops

**Rotation Animation System**:

- **Movement-Based Rotation**: Ball rotates based on ground movement direction
- **Flight Rotation**: Dynamic rotation during basketball flight based on velocity
- **Rotation Decay**: Gradual slowdown when ball stops moving
- **Realistic Physics**: Rotation axis matches movement direction with proper scaling

**Shot Mechanics**:

- **Power-Based Velocity**: Shot strength affects initial velocity (0-100% power range)
- **Automatic Targeting**: Calculates optimal trajectory to nearest hoop
- **Arc Calculation**: Ensures proper basketball arc height for realistic shots
- **Distance-Based Scoring**: 2-point shots (inside 3-point line) vs 3-point shots

### Performance Optimizations

- **Time-Based Physics**: Prevents frame rate dependency
- **Collision Optimization**: Efficient detection algorithms
- **State Management**: Proper physics state cleanup and reset mechanisms

## Additional Features

- **Modern, interactive 3D basketball court** using Three.js
- **Orbit camera controls** (toggle with 'O' key)
- **Free camera mode** (toggle with 'F' key) with WASD movement and arrow key rotation
- **Responsive UI overlays** for score and controls
- **HUD toggle** (press 'H' to show/hide interface elements)

### Enhanced Visual Features

- **Realistic wood grain texture** on court floor with procedural generation
- **Professional team logos** at center court with custom basketball-themed design
- **Improved basketball net** with more vertical strands, horizontal rings, and natural curve
- **Enhanced backboard design** with orange borders and shooter's square matching real basketball courts
- **Professional lighting system** with ambient, spotlight, and hemisphere lighting
- **Detailed court markings** including three-point lines, key areas, free throw circles, and center court circle

### Interactive Controls

- **Camera Controls:**
  - 'O' - Toggle orbit controls
  - 'H' - Toggle HUD visibility
  - 'F' - Toggle free camera mode
- **Free Camera Mode:**
  - WASD - Movement in free camera mode
  - QE - Up/down movement in free camera mode
  - Arrow keys - Camera rotation in free camera mode

### Technical Enhancements

- **Advanced materials** with proper shininess and specular properties
